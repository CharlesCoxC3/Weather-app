Five Day Forecast Weather App

## Description
Was asked to build an application that would display the forecast for the next 5 days for an upcoming trip.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The application can be used to search for a city and see its projected weather for the next five days. If a name of a city is clicked for a previous search, it should load that city data from local storage..also the app should load the last city looked at from the search.
